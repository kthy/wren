World of Warships Renamer
================================================================================

Unzip the zipfile into any directory you'd like. The only important thing is
that wren.exe and wren.cfg are in the same directory (folder).

Now open wren.cfg with e.g. Notepad and check that the wowsPath at the top
matches the WoWs bin directory on your computer. If you're running WoWs through
Steam, it should be fine. Don't touch anything else in the file, unless you're
feeling particularly adventurous.

If you simply double click the exe file now, the next time you start WoWs you
should see the ship names in your game prefixed with markers showing which ones
are (potentially) equipped with radar plus the range. As an example, "Minotaur"
will display as "Ï†10 Minotaur".

You will need to re-run the program after each update from Wargaming.net.

If you see ships in-game with radar that are not marked as such, please let me
know at <thy@42.dk>, and I will issue an update.

It goes without saying that the changes made by this program are local and only
visible in your own game client.
